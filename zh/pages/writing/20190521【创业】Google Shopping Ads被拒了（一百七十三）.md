#【创业】Google Shopping Ads被拒了（一百七十三）

一直pending 了4个工作日之后，眼看着进入了第5个工作日。却发现在Google Merchant Center里，Product List全红了，不仅仅是Shopping Ads Products变成红色的Disapproved，连之前是绿色Active 的Surfaces across Google products 也在同一时间变成了Disapproved。

Feeds、Product List以及Diagnostics里没有任何提示信息，赶紧打开Gmail查找，发现8小时前有两封邮件，其中一封是说我的Account被Suspend了

按道理说，我们的这两个产品应该是属于允许范围才对，在上面的链接里，明明写着下面这句话：

**Software subscriptions that are pre-paid and auto-renew only annually are allowed.**

但不管怎么说，人家的地盘人家做主，只能再仔仔细细对照着这篇[Best practices for advertising software subscriptions](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7169130?hl=en)，把Landing Page，还有产品的描述再好好修改调整下试试。
